# GoldSrcNetworking

P2P networking support for GoldSrc games.

## Building

Use Visual Studio 2019 to build the project.

## Installation

- Copy `Client.exe` that was built before to your GoldSrc game folder.
- Additionally, the file can be renamed to `<mod>.exe` (for instance, `cstrike.exe`) so you can launch the mod directly.

Note that you cannot connect to other players that are not using this library.

## Will I get VAC banned?

Maybe, maybe not. If you just use this to play with friends then should be OK since listen server does not enable VAC by default.
